# Person Fall Detection (Internet Of Things Project)

## Objective:
- Monitor old people so that their fall is detected and a notification is sent to their caretaker for further help.
- Send immediate response to the family member or nearby hospital via Text message and missed call. 

## Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- Fall detection hardware integrated into belt (Arduino along with relevant actuators and sensors)

> Run .ino file using Arduino IDE and upload it to Arduino (with relevant sensors and actuators)

> Main sensors used here are MPU6050(Accelerometer and Gyro sensor) and GSM module.
